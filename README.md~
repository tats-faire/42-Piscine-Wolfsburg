# 42-Piscine-Wolfsburg

Everything survived the tests except for the following exercises:
C02, ex11
C03, ex05
C04, ex04 & ex05
Sh00, ex08
I revised them all, but I cannot guarantee that all errors are purged.
had an error that should be fixed now (but no guarantee).

As for the Rushes:
Rush00: 92 points - had one error that is now fixed (printed newline if input is 0).
Rush01: 0 points. Repo only consists of a function that will test for valid input.
Rush02: 125 points. Bonus points were for the library for Esperanto, an artificial language created in 1887 and still in use today.
